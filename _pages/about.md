I'm an Applied Research Scientist at [Element AI](http://elementai.com) working on applying the latest developments in natural language processing and information retrieval for a [knowledge management and discovery product](https://www.elementai.com/products/knowledge-scout). I also worked on problems in information extraction and document understanding for an [automated document processing product](https://www.elementai.com/products/document-intelligence).

I completed my MAsc with [Dr. Mark Crowley](https://markcrowley.ca/) and [Dr. Joon Lee](https://www.ucalgary.ca/future-students/graduate/supervisor/joon-lee) in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of Waterloo working on data-driven decision making in healthcare. My research focused on developing methods for home health monitoring and data-driven decision-making systems using the abundance of data coming from various devices today. 

Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at Concordia University in Montreal. During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a research intern at NTT in Japan on media event detection from online videos and worked on digital signal processing and embedded systems as a research assistant at Concordia University with Thales. Finally, I completed co-op internships as a software developer in aerospace at CAE and participated in many extra-curricular activities in robotic competitions and electronics projects.
 
In my free time, I love playing basketball, hiking, camping and cycling.
