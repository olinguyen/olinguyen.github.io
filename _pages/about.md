I'm an Applied Research Scientist at [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/) that joined through the acquisition of [Element AI](http://elementai.com). I work on problems in NLP (question answering, semantic search, language understanding) and everything around it (research, engineering, scaling).
Some of my highlights at Element AI are building and deploying NLP models for [Knowledge Scout](https://www.elementai.com/products/knowledge-scout) to deliver smarter search capabilities on unstructured data, and developing document entity extraction models for [Document Intelligence](https://www.elementai.com/products/document-intelligence) to automate document processing.

I completed my MAsc with [Dr. Mark Crowley](https://markcrowley.ca/) and [Dr. Joon Lee](https://www.ucalgary.ca/future-students/graduate/supervisor/joon-lee) in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of Waterloo working on data-driven decision making in healthcare. My research focused on developing methods for home health monitoring and data-driven decision-making systems using the abundance of data coming from various devices today. 

Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at Concordia University in Montreal. During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a research intern at NTT in Japan on media event detection from online videos and worked on digital signal processing and embedded systems as a research assistant at Concordia University with Thales. I also completed co-op internships as a software developer in aerospace at CAE and participated in many extra-curricular activities in robotic competitions and electronics projects.
 
In my free time, I like playing basketball, hiking, camping and cycling.
